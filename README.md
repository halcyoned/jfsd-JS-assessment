Note: Up down left right are controlled by keys "W A S D" respectively! I find that it is more intuitive this way :)

What did you like about this project?
A lot of guidance was given. Framework was laid out and carefully explained, which was very helpful in understanding the base framework. It was also a good test of logic.

What did you struggle with in this project?
Getting the function calls correct. Familiarizing myself with the constructor class. Setting up the npm package. Refactoring the code because I feel my code is still too chunky.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Standardizing the steps for setting up the npm package. More structured assessment criteria can also be given (e.g. char has to start from what position, victory conditions, failure conditions).
